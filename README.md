## A world events database web application.

The single page application was created for easy search of events around the world. Search by keyword or country. The slider displays random popular events. Details of the selected event are displayed in a modal window. It is possible to switch to third-party resources with more information about the event or to buy tickets.

### I used in this project:

- HTML
- SCSS
- JavaScript
- AJAX
- requests REST API
- templating Handlebars
- local storage
- pagination
- lazy sizes
- adaptive web design
- Flexbox and Grids
- Webpack
- some libraries and plugins (GSAP, slider Glide.js, notifications Izitoast, spinner Spin.js, parallax, ets, )
